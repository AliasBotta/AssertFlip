First, carefully read the ISSUE TICKET and inspect the collected CODE SNIPPETS.
Review the THOUGHT PROCESS of your junior and identify the mistakes made in the previous plan.
Analyze the problem reported critically and create a new PLAN from scratch with no reference to the previous one
Use the following steps:

<bug_analysis>
1. Analyze the issue ticket:
   - Identify the key components of the reported bug
   - Note any specific conditions or scenarios mentioned
   - Quote relevant parts of the issue ticket

2. Review the code snippets:
   - Identify the relevant parts of the code that might be causing the bug
   - Look for any potential edge cases or boundary conditions
   - Quote relevant parts of the code snippets

3. Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:
   - Identify the main flaws in their approach
   - Note any correct insights or partial solutions

4. Analyze the error received:
   - Determine if the error is related to the test implementation or the actual bug

5. List potential test cases:
   1. [Test case 1]
   2. [Test case 2]
   3. [Test case 3]
   ...

6. Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:
   1. [Trigger method 1]
   2. [Trigger method 2]
   3. [Trigger method 3]
   ...

7. Evaluate approaches:
   - Pros and cons of each potential test case and trigger method
   - Select the most promising approach

8. Formulate a new approach:
   - Devise a strategy to trigger the bug consistently
   - Plan how to structure the test to pass normal cases but fail for the bug
   - Consider edge cases and potential variations of the bug

9. Outline test components:
   - Determine necessary setup and teardown steps
   - Plan input data or mock objects required
   - Identify assertions needed to expose the bug
</bug_analysis>

Based on your analysis, create a detailed plan for writing the test. Your plan should focus on the logical structure and approach, without delving into specific implementation details of any testing framework. Ensure your plan is thorough and covers all aspects of triggering and exposing the bug.

If you need any information that has been trimmed away, or are missing information from the codebase you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it. You are encouraged to use it at this step to perfect the plan.                    
Remember, do not write the actual test code. Focus on creating a comprehensive correct plan that will guide the junior developer in implementing an effective test.

DO NOT provide implementation specific details pertaining to any testing framework. The project may use its own testing framework or a specific library so it could be misleading to provide such details.

You WILL be PENALIZED for copying the previous plan or any part of it. Use it to gain insights of what DOES NOT work, but do not reference it in your new plan.

You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.

You are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.

First, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET

<ISSUE_TICKET>
{problem_statement}
</ISSUE_TICKET>

Follow these rules:
	1.	Only change whatâ€™s needed.
	2.	Keep the test structure exactly the same.
	3.	Update any assertions to check for the correct behavior.
	4.	Remove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.
	5.	Keep it readable. Keep it minimal.
	6.	The test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.
	7.	The test must pass once the bug is fixed.

Output the full updated test code in a single python code block â€” no extra text, no placeholders.
