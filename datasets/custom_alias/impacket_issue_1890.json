    "problem_statement": "When decoding IPv6 packets in ImpactPacket.load_header, Impacket v0.12.0 raised 'TypeError: can't concat str to bytes'. The function attempted to pad the packet buffer (aBuffer) with the string '\\x00' when the buffer was shorter than the 40-byte IPv6 header length. Because aBuffer is a bytes object, concatenating a string caused a runtime TypeError. The correct fix is to use b'\\x00' so that padding uses bytes instead of strings.",
